# The Symbolic Lighthouse: Resolving Hallucinations in Language Models through Recursive Symbolic Architectures

**White Paper v1.0.0** – **Author:** Rogério Figurelli @ Trajecta Labs – **Date:** 2025-05-21

## Opening Statement

*Only when guided by symbolic lighthouses can linguistic vessels safely navigate between truth and illusion.*

## 1. Central Problem

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools capable of generating human-like text at scale \[1]. Despite their fluency, these models frequently generate outputs known as hallucinations—plausible yet factually incorrect or epistemically ungrounded statements \[2]. Such hallucinations compromise trust, reliability, and applicability of LLMs in sensitive domains including healthcare, law, education, and decision-making systems \[3]. Current mitigation techniques such as supervised fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and retrieval augmentation only partially address this issue, highlighting the need for deeper structural solutions \[4].
